# Ditto

<img align="right" height="300" src="Docs/umbraco-ditto.png">

Ditto is a lightweight POCO mapper for Umbraco 7. It offers a generic, unopinionated
solution to the problem of using **strongly-typed models in your MVC views**.
There are no 3<sup>rd</sup> party dependencies, other than Umbraco 7 core itself.

### Is Ditto a "Yet Another Code-First" approach?

Nope! The goal of Ditto is to provide a simple way to convert your content/media nodes (e.g. `IPublishedContent`) to your desired POCO/model/object.

There is absolutely zero intention of generating Document-Types from your POCO/models.
